/**
 * Path objects represent the path of travel for the adversaries in
 * our Tower Defense game.  A path is just a series of sequential
 * line segments.  A game object's position on the path is specified
 * by a 'percentage', or amount of the path that has been completed.
 * The start of the path is 0% completed, the end of the path is 100%
 * completed.  (The range is 0.0 to 1.0 as a double.)
 *
 * This class was completed as part of checkpoint #1.  (You shouldn't
 * need to change it.)
